By Kibrom Haftu  <br />
This repository contains the following files:

## README.md
README.md, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
tidy_data.txt, which contains the data set.
CodeBook.md, the code book, which describes the contents of the data set (data, variables and transformations used to generate the data).
run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set (see the Creating the data set section below)
## Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set 
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script
